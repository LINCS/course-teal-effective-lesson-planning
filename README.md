# course-teal-effective-lesson-planning
This Moodle course is for Effective Lesson Planning. Planning is critical in identifying appropriate action steps to help one effectively reach a goal. Lesson plans help instructors set learning objectives and they provide a road map by which instructors can organize content, materials, time, instructional strategies and assistance in the classroom. They also represent a way to communicate to learners what they will learn and how they will be assessed. In this course, you will learn some techniques to make the most of your planning time and maximize collaboration with your peers.
